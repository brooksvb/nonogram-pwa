# Nonogram PWA

[Live Demo on Github Pages](https://brooksvb.github.io/nonogram-pwa)

This is a project I developed in order to test out a new tech stack and experiment with making a PWA.

My main inspiration came from a Nonogram app that I used some years back, until it disappeared from the app store and I never found a replacement I liked. My goals were to replicate some of the UI and UX elements of the app that I remembered liking a lot. Particularly some of the drag selection behavior for marking cells in the grid.

## Technologies Used
- Typescript
- Svelte
- Svelte-Kit, Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Jest
- Progressive Web Apps

## Using as a PWA
This app works well as a PWA! To install it on your device, open the options menu in your browser, and look for the "Add to home screen" option.

## Building and Previewing
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploying to Github Pages
